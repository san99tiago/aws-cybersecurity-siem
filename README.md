# 🏴‍☠️ AWS-CYBERSECURITY-SIEM 🏴‍☠️

An advanced CyberSecurity SIEM/XDR solution designed for AWS Organizations with a multi-account architecture. This project is deployed using Infrastructure as Code through AWS CDK, integrating the powerful OpenSource Wazuh platform to enhance protection, monitoring, and security best practices for cloud-native workloads.

> I developed this as part of my CyberSecurity Master's Thesis, and now, this solution also safeguards my personal workloads!
